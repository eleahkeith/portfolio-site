[ ]nav bar is over the scroll bar on desktop
[ ]can't get scrollY to register anything other than 0, 
    can't figure out how to get a new banner.
[x]when overlay is added, there is extra Y on my iphone. tried overflow hidden,
    tried making overlay shorter than display...something to do with not being able to 
    scroll maybe? for now, removing overlay and widening the menu.
