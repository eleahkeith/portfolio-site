            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Leah and I'm a front-end software engineer. I am
              passionate about creating responsive, accessible websites for all
              types of devices. I primarily use React & TypeScript + HTML5/CSS3,
              but I love learning new languages and frameworks and I'm
              constantly growing my knowledge base.

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
              My software development career began in early 2020 when I attended
              a web development bootcamp at <a href="#">23 Code Street</a> based
              in London. My pre-dev career history includes project manager,
              group account manager at a large insurance company, and a friendly
              retail manager.

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              Because I've spent so many years working with people and clients,
              I take a people-first approach to development. Tech exists to
              improve the lives of its stakeholders, so the client or user
              should be at the center of everything we do.

            <h2>Me IRL</h2>
            <p>
              Outside of development, I'm an avid knitter, gamer, and baker. I
              am from the US originally, but I now live in the UK with my dog
              Luke and my husband Sam, both of whom I'm completely obsessed
              with.
